LuminAID was the first project that I got to work on. LuminAID is based on Bluetooth lamps with RGB colors. It is a controller app using which one can connect to their Bluetooth lights and control them by changing colors and patterns. One can even set Timer to schedule on and off period of Bluetooth lights. 

My primary goal in this project was to upgrade it to its new design. I also worked on memory & performance optimization on lower-end devices. I also got to implement the Timer feature and neon light effects on the Android App.
