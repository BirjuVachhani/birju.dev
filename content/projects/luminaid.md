## About

The LuminAID Smart Solar Garden is an interactive Bluetooth lighting system that integrates seamlessly into your backyard or patio.

LuminAID was the first project that I got to work on. LuminAID is based on Bluetooth lamps with RGB colors. It is a controller app using which one can connect to their Bluetooth lights and control them by changing colors and patterns. One can even set Timer to schedule on and off period of Bluetooth lights.

With this App, you'll be able to:

* Set the mood of your lights by choosing from thousands of colors
* Increase the brightness of your lights, apply a pre-programmed pattern, or save your favorite colors.
* Create groups of lights in order to control a few lights at the same time. For example, have a few lights you want to float in your pool? Turn them all on/off at the same time by creating a Pool group, or change the color of the Pool group to illuminate your evening swim.
* Set schedules for your lights to turn on and off at a certain time. Have a party coming up? Greet your guests by turning on your lights at the time that they arrive.

## My Roll

* This was my first project as a Software Engineer.
* Conversion of old UI to a new fresh design.
* Memory & performance optimization for lower devices.
* Introduced Scheduling feature to schedule on/off timings for BLE lights.
* Implementation of neon glowing effects for light color picker.
* UI & UX improvements.
* Simulation mode implementation for testing without physical BLE lights.
