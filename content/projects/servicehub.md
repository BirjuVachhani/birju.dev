## About

ServiceHub is a good, safe and digital case handling service of vehicle faults, demages and other cases.

The app is targeted to be used by drivers mostly. Driver can select the bus he is riding and can view all the issues reported to that particular vehicle and can see current status for the resolution of that issues.
