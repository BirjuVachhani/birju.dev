## About

ProximiPRO provides context aware and contact less communication using beacons, geo-location and QR Codes. It is simple and easy to use proximity marketing platform that allows you to easily set up your zones (Bluetooth beacons or geolocations) to deliver content in the right place at the right time. 

It provides a complete set of tools for engagement with built-in analytics. I was working on Engage SDK for native Android platform that enables easy integration of this proximity marketing in android applications.

## My Roll

* Develop the whole Android SDK to scan, detect and identify specific beacons, track beacon events and perform actions based on triggered events.
* The SDK authenticates users and manages beacon zone sessions.
* Support active and passive scanning for better battery optimization.
* Maintain SDK documentation and user guide.
* Implementation of built-in analytics in the SDK.
* Implementation of services to support background scans.
* Doze mode compatibility for better battery performace.
* Develop a demo app showing how to use the SDK.
* Publishing the SDK and managing artifacts.
* Proper QA level testing of functionalities.
* Guidance for development of React-Native plugin and IOS SDK as well.
