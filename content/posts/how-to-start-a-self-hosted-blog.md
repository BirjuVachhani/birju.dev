Howdy People! **Starting a blog** was one of the things from my list of **Things To Do-2018**. If you are reading this right now then I guess it must have been into your wish list too. Like me, many people are confused about how to start a blog?, which service to us?, should it be self hosted or not? blah blah blah. Well, I have been to that phase too. So, today Iâ€™m going to help you out for starting a blog.

### Why A Self Hosted Blog?

Many of you must have been thinking that why I have to host it? Canâ€™t I use one of the services available already like **googleâ€™s Blogspot, wordpress.com, Medium,** etc. Well, Of course you can use it but I do not recommend it.

When you use a blog service, you donâ€™t have control of certain things. If the service is stopped for some reason then your blog will be in trouble. You can compare and read more about **Free Blog vs Self Hosted Blog** [here](https://www.bloggingbasics101.com/should-i-choose-a-free-or-a-self-hosted-blogging-platform/). Here, we are going to host it by ourselves.

### What is WordPress?

WordPress is an online, open source, easiest and most powerful blogging and website content management system (CMS) in existence today. We will use wordpress.org which is free blogging platform that can be used on self-hosted basis. There are several CMS services available like Blogger, Medium, Wix, Tumblr, Joomla, etc. But among these all, wordpress is the most popular.

You can read about differences between wordpress.com and wordpress.org [here](https://startbloggingonline.com/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org-whats-the-difference/).

So, letâ€™s start creating your self hosted wordpress blog. These are the steps that needs to be followed.

### Steps

1. Register a domain name.
2. Register to a hosting service.
3. Install & Configure WordPress.
4. Writing your first post.

### 1. Register A Domain Name

First of all, youâ€™ll need a domain name to get started with your own self hosted blog. You can get domain any domain name like **.com, .org, .net,** etc. Getting these domains will cost you a little. There are many free domains are available as well like **.tk, .cf, .ml,** etc. If you want to start your blog free of cost then you can register one of the free domains. If you have already got your domain then you can skip to the next step.

To get free domains, there are lots of services available that you can google. Here I am going to use [freenom.com](http://www.freenom.com). Go to [freenom.com](http://www.freenom.com) and register yourself. After that, go to **services > Register a new domain**.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_01.png" alt="Register a New Domain" position="center" caption="Register a New Domain" >}}

Enter your **desired domain name** (without extension) and see if it is **available.** You can choose any from the list that is **free.** Rest is going to cost you some **bucks.** Select your domain name and click on **checkout** option.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_02.png" alt="Checkout Domain Purchase" position="center" caption="Checkout Domain Purchase" >}}

Select the **period** for which you want the domain name. If youâ€™re not sure about it then select **12 months** which is the **highest time** allowed as **cost free.** Click on **continue** after that.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_03.png" alt="Domain Purchase Period" position="center" caption="Domain Purchase Period" >}}

Now, **checkout** form will open. Fill up the details required and click on **complete order** to checkout.

If you see following order confirmation screen that Itâ€™s Great! You have registered your domain successfully.

### 2. Register To A Hosting Service

There are a large number of hosting services available. The one we want should support WordPress and should be free initially. [**infinityfree.net**](https://infinityfree.net/) is such a service we can host on here. So, go to [**infinityfree.net**](https://infinityfree.net/) website and register your self.

After registering successfully, go to **client area** and click on **New Account** button.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_05.png" alt="New Hosting Account" position="center" caption="New Hosting Account" >}}

Enter your domain name in **Use your Own Domain** section.Donâ€™t click the **check** button yet. we have some configurations to do.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_06.png" alt="Use Your Own Domain" position="center" caption="Use Your Own Domain" >}}

Now, you need to link our domain with this hosting account. To do that you need to set **Namespace servers** of this hosting service to our domain service. To do that, copy nameservers provided as shown below.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_07.png" alt="Namespace Servers" position="center" caption="Namespace Servers" >}}

Now, go to domain service [**freenom.com**](http://www.freenom.com) and navigate to **services > My domains**. Click on **Manage Domain** button in the right side of the domain you have registered.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_08.png" alt="Manage Domain" position="center" caption="Manage Domain" >}}

Now, go to **Management Tools > Nameservers**.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_09.png" alt="Management Tools: Nameservers" position="center" caption="Management Tools: Nameservers" >}}

Select **Use custom Nameservers** option and paste **nameservers** that you have **copied earlier** as shown below. then click on **Change Nameservers**. It will take some time to apply changes.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_10.png" alt="Change Nameservers" position="center" caption="Change Nameservers" >}}

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_12.png" alt="Open Control Panel" position="center" caption="Open Control Panel" >}}

It will open the control panel. Scroll down to **Software Section** and click on **Softaculous App Installer.** Itâ€™s an App installer tool to install WordPress like tools.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_13.png" alt="Softaculous App Installer" position="center" caption="Softaculous App Installer" >}}

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_14.png" alt="Install WordPress" position="center" caption="Install WordPress" >}}

Now, It will open a form for WordPress setup. Fill up the form and these are some import things to be careful with.

#### Setting Root Directory for WordPress

The **In Directory** field is important. It defines where the WordPress will be installed. By default, it is installed in **wp** directory but in our case, our whole blog will be running on WordPress only so we will install WordPress in the root directory of our site. To do that leave that field empty(remove wp). So that it will install WordPress in the root directory.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_15.png" alt="WordPress Root Directory" position="center" caption="WordPress Root Directory" >}}

#### Setting Admin Credentials

It is very important to choose proper username and a strong password as it protects the WordPress control panel from which you can access your blogâ€™s tools like themes, posts, plugins, settings, media, etc. So choose them carefully.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_16.png" alt="WordPress: Admin Account" position="center" caption="WordPress: Admin Account" >}}

Donâ€™t change anything in **Advanced Options** if you are not sure what it does. At last, select a proper theme for the given options. If you donâ€™t like any then donâ€™t worry. You can change it later. Click on **install** button once you are done with all the details.

It will take a few minutes to install the WordPress. If everything goes well then you will see following screen.

{{< figure src="/assets/images/2018-11-25-start-a-blog/screenshot_17.png" alt="WordPress: Admin Panel URL" position="center" caption="WordPress: Admin Panel URL" >}}
