# About Me

Hi there! I am Birju Vachhani, from Junagadh, India. I am a Sr. software Engineer working as a Flutter Developer at [Codelessly Inc](https://codelessly.com). I am also a [Google Certified Associate Android Developer](https://www.credential.net/d95f992e-f9b1-4c29-88c4-1b953e52b763). As a developer, I love Kotlin and I love to play around with Kotlin a lot. I also do open source contribution by developing Kotlin libraries. You can checkout my work on my [Github](https://github.com/birjuvachhani) Profile. In my free time, I play computer games like NFS, CS, COD, Assassin's Creed, etc. I love to write about programming so I started my own blog. 

Currently I'm exploring flutter and Jetpack Compose. As a hobby, I love to do photography. You can find some cool stuff related to it on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/birjuvachhani). Apart from that, I am also interested in CI/CD, Ktor and Kotlin Multiplatform projects and I try to explore these as much as I can.
