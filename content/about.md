### About Me

Hello! I’m Birju Vachhani, a passionate and experienced [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) Developer with a deep expertise in creating high-quality, cross-platform applications. With years of hands-on experience, I specialize in developing mobile, web, and desktop apps using Flutter and Firebase, ensuring seamless performance across iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and the web.

Currently, I work at [**Codelessly Inc**](https://codelessly.com), where I lead the development of Codelessly UI Builder and Cloud UI solutions. My focus is on building intuitive, scalable, and efficient user interfaces that make app development easier and more accessible for everyone.

I’ve had the privilege of creating apps that enhance productivity and streamline daily tasks. [**Target Mate**](https://github.com/BirjuVachhani/target_mate), a companion app for [Toggl Track](https://track.toggl.com), helps users track their work hours more effectively. [**Hyper Zones**](https://hyperzones.app), a beautifully designed app for timezone tracking, has gained traction across platforms like Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Web.

Beyond app development, I am an active contributor to the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) community. I’ve authored and maintain several open-source Flutter packages, including [**adaptive_theme**](https://pub.dev/packages/adaptive_theme), [**spider**](https://pub.dev/packages/spider), [**screwdriver**](https://pub.dev/packages/screwdriver), [**flutter_box_transform**](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_box_transform), and [**hyper_effects**](https://pub.dev/packages/hyper_effects). You can explore these projects on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/birju.dev/packages).

I have a solid background in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) services such as Firestore, Authentication, Storage, and Functions, and I’m skilled in integrating push notifications for enhanced user engagement. I also have strong experience with CI/CD pipelines, using tools like [**CodeMagic**](https://codemagic.io), [**Fastlane**](https://fastlane.tools), **Github Actions**, and **Bitrise** to streamline deployment across platforms.

With expertise in building CLI Apps, Dart servers, cron jobs, and Google Cloud Scheduler, I enjoy taking on complex technical challenges and turning them into scalable, maintainable solutions. My ability to deliver clean, well-tested code and work collaboratively in agile teams has been key to my success in both individual and team-driven projects.

As a hobby, I love to do photography. In my free time, I am either playing computer games like NFS, CS, COD, Assassin's Creed, etc or tinking with raspberry pi and coding.

I’m always excited to collaborate with like-minded professionals who share the same passion for innovation and problem-solving. If you’d like to discuss a project or potential collaboration, feel free to reach out!
